Gradient Descent for Height Prediction based on Weight
Overview
This Python project implements gradient descent to predict the height of individuals based on their weight. It utilizes a simple linear regression model to establish the relationship between weight and height and then optimizes the model parameters using gradient descent.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains measurements of weight and height for a sample of individuals. The data is in CSV format and can be found in the data directory.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
